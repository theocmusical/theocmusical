<h4>Characters</h4>

<p><em>Note: The specified age indicates the character’s age, not the actor’s age.</em></p>

<p><strong>Ryan Atwood</strong> (16, baritenor): A bad boy as a result of his rough upbringing in Chino, California. Silent, strong type with sex appeal. Experience with stage combat would be an asset for this role.</p>

<p><strong>Seth Cohen</strong> (16, tenor): Nerdy, Jewish loner with a keen interest in graphic novels, video games, and indie bands. Seth must be a fast talker with excellent comedic timing, and a strong singer.</p>

<p><strong>Marissa Cooper</strong> (16, alto): Always seen with a flask in hand, Marissa has been dating Luke Ward since sixth grade, but is quickly enamoured by Ryan when he arrives in Newport. Marissa must be a strong comedic actor.</p>

<p><strong>Summer Roberts</strong> (16, mezzo): Marissa’s materialistic, judgmental best friend with a penchant for the word “ew”. Summer’s bitchy attitude is a guard for her softer side. </p>

<p><strong>Trey Atwood</strong> (20, baritenor): Ryan’s older brother, who is a multiple-time criminal offender. Trey gets Ryan involved with stealing cars and is generally unstable. Experience with stage combat would be an asset for this role.</p>

<p><strong>Luke Ward</strong> (16, tenor): A vain, pretty jock who has been dating Marissa since sixth grade. </p>

<p><strong>Julie Cooper</strong> (45, alto/baritone): Marissa’s overbearing mother with “MILF” sex appeal. May be played by a woman or a man in drag.</p>

<p><strong>Sandy Cohen</strong> (45, baritone): Seth’s Jewish father. He is a public defender who takes Ryan, his client, in off the streets. Attempting to be a cool dad, Sandy cracks lame jokes that embarrass Seth. </p>

<p><strong>Kirsten Cohen</strong> (45, mezzo): Seth’s non-Jewish mother; daughter of a rich real estate mogul. She is nervous about Ryan living in her home.</p>

<p><strong>Holly Fischer</strong> (16): Typical mean girl who comes between Luke and Marissa. </p>

<p><strong>J'Lynne</strong> (16): Fallen-from-grace out of Newport’s high society, J’Lynne is now poor and destitute, living in Chino.</p>

<p><strong>Brice, Chadwick, Preston, Theo</strong> - Waterpolo Team (16): Macho and self-congratulatory. The waterpolo team must be strong dancers.</p>

<p><strong>Crystal, Naomi, Tatiana</strong> - Harbor Girls (16): Rich, private school girls that party hard.</p>
